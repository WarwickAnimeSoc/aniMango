### Running the project
To run the project, the best way to go about doing so is to clone the repo into a directory, set-up the virtual-env and install all of the dependencies. Current dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`. Once this has been ran, if on a local machine, you will need to create the config files. These are not included in the program until I get round to cleaning them up. As such, for any future webmasters, clone the repo, and then copy in the files that are missing from the server.

A local version of the site will also require a MySQL server running in the same format as the one on the main site. Once this is configured, run `python manage.py runserver` to execute the site.

### API Documentation

API Documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/WarwickAnimeSoc/aniMango/wiki/API-Endpoints). More endpoints will be added as time goes on.
