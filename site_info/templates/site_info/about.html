            The Anime and Manga Society is Warwick's student-run society for anyone with an interest in Anime and Manga.
            The society is for anyone who would like to meet others who share these interests, or who just want to join
            us for one of the many events we run each academic year. </p>

            <p>Our regular viewings take place in <a
                href="http://campus-cms.warwick.ac.uk/share/a9937c640809938d7dd7b008860e59ee">MS.05 (on the second floor
            of the Maths Building)</a>, starting at 18:30
            every Tuesday during term time from Week 1 onwards. These events incorporate time for socialising as well as
            watching anime, so they're an excellent opportunity to meet others and have fun.

            In addition to this, we also hold many socials and other <a
                        href="{% url 'events:upcoming' page=1 %}">events</a> across the year such as:</p>
            <ul class="collection">
                <li class="collection-item">All-nighters — extended showings where we watch a selection of things that
                    may not fit our usual format,
                    with plenty of breaks for food and socialising.
                </li>
                <li class="collection-item">Art/cosplay workshops — a chance to get help and advice with any projects
                    you might be working on, or just
                    generally chat with others about art or cosplay.
                </li>
                <li class="collection-item">MCM trip — we usually go to the MCM London Comic Con during term 1.</li>
                <li class="collection-item">Meals — socials where we enjoy the restaurants around Coventry.
                </li>
            </ul>
            We also have an extensive <a href="{% url 'library:index' %}">library</a> of anime to watch and manga to
            read, available for our members to borrow.
